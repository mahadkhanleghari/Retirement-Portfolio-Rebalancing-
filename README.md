# Retirement Portfolio Rebalancing 

This project focuses on rebalancing a portfolio, using starting and ending percentages set by the user. Every year, a salaried person sets aside a certain amount to invest into different securities. 

1. Run the file "User Input".
2. A plot will show you how your portfolio changes over time till your retirement year. 
3. The historical returns for stocks and bonds are in separate text files.
4. If you wish to use historical returns from stocks from different websites using their APIs, you are more than welcome to.
5. The rebalancing is done by simply resetting the allocated percentage for that year by the end of the year. 
6. Important Note: Savings are not used to invest but simply cumulatively increase in accordance with that year's return.
